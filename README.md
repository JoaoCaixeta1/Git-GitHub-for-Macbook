# Git + GitHub for Macbook

## I will teach how to make a GitHub repository using Git for the Macbook users.

### 1ยบ: Creating a repository on GitHub
* First, we need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and then let's create a repository.
* On the page, it has two options to create: `private` or `public` repository. You must choose what you prefer, if it's a private repository that only you can see, or a public that anyone who access your page can visit.

* After choose the kind of repository you want, just click on `create a new repository` and the next must be;

* Just click on the circled option and the README option will be created.
* You can edit with instructions from your repository or whatever you want to describe about your work. People often create to provide the "repository manual".
